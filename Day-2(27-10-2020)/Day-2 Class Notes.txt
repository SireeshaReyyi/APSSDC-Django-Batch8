Today Objectives:
------------------
1.Inheritance
2.Modules
3.Packages

Inheritance:
--------------
-> We are tring to Inheriting something from parent class to child class

general format is : ChildClass(ParentClass):

We have few diff types of Inheritances

1.Single Level Inheritance
-> In this there is a only one parent class and only one child class

4.Hybrid Inheritance
-> It is Combination of all above means multilevel,multible,singlelevel



Module:
--------
-> It is a .py file
-> It contains Collection of Functions or Classes
-> For Accessing the modules we are using import keyword
 	import MyModule
	MyModule.ClassName.fun()
	MyModule.Fun()

Package:
--------
-> It is a Folder
-> In This Folder Conatains group of modules
for import the package few diff ways there

	from package import module
	from package import module,module1,module2
	from package import *
	from package.module import class
	from package.module import function
